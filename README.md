# Ryan Builds Stuff

This repo is to gather app ideas for educating and entertainment.
The idea is to gather weekend projects that you may not have time to build or problems you'd like to see worked on or solved.

> **This is not a place for you to pitch a business idea or have me build a business for you for free**

This is a place to bring together cool ideas to make small to medium sized projects to help make learning development more accessible.
I hope to solve cool projects but in scale things probably will be about a weekend or two.

I will be streaming all projects on my Twitch channel: http://twitch.tv/onelastword.
All code from streams will be posted within the `onelastword` organization on Github: http://github.com/onelastword

## Types of Projects

To keep things orderly, here are a few tips for project suggestions:

* Day to day tasks (guitar practice tracker)
* Silly ideas (think place cage)
* Civic projects (pot hole tracker, parking locator, etc)

## How to Submit a Project

If you have a project idea you are wanting to sumbit, please [create an issue](https://github.com/onelastword/ryan-builds-stuff/issues/new).
When possible, add a few bullets with:

* Background (why should the app )
* User stories (As a user I should be able to...)
* Other resources or inspiration

## Licensing and Legal

All code from streams will be released under the [MIT license](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
No other copyright or licensing will be held beyond this.
